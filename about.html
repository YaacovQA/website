Allow me to introduce myself briefly. My name is Yaacov Mettoudi, and I am currently 28 years old. I reside in Hadera, and I am happily married with two adorable daughters. My eldest is 3 years old, while my youngest is just 7 months.

At the age of 18, I had the privilege of serving in the IDF's Golani Brigade, which is part of the Israeli Defense Force.
